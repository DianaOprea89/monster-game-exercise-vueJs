# monster-game-exercise-vueJs

 This is a javaScript exercise i did while watching the course of Vue Complete Guide  from Udemy Academy, and i did it along side the trainner. It was a good exercise to practice all the core features like interpolation,  v-bind ,v-on, v-if, v-else, v-for, methods, watch and computed.
